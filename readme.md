# Terminal Hacking Statistics Generator!

For some background on this project, please check out my [blog](http://www.mathgoespop.com/2016/04/fallout-4-math.html).

This is a simple command-line tool that will take in a list of words (one of which is assumed to be a special password), and an algorithm, and will tell you how successful that algorithm is in finding the password. Inspired by the terminal hacking mini-game found in _Fallout 3_, _Fallout: New Vegas_, and _Fallout 4_. 

For details on the algorithms and sample word lists, check out the blog.

To get started, make sure you have node installed. Then run `npm install`, and when that's finished just type `node app`. The prompts will walk you through the rest.
